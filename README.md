## Usage

Follow these easy steps to integrate the cookie settings in your page.

### 1. Install cookie-consent-js in your project with `npm install cookie-consent-js`

Alternatively you can download the [git repository](https://github.com/shaack/cookie-consent-js).

### 2. Include `cookie-consent.css`

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/node_modules/cookie-consent-js/src/cookie-consent.css"/>
```

This should be done before any bootstrap or other frameworks css. You can overwrite styling in your projects css, take a
look at [cookie-consent.scss](https://github.com/shaack/cookie-consent-js/blob/master/src/cookie-consent.scss).

### 3. Include `cookie-consent.js`

```html
<script src="/node_modules/cookie-consent-js/src/cookie-consent.js"></script>
```

In your websites `<head>` or at the bottom of the `<body>`.

### 4. Initialize the Script

```js
const cookieConsent = new CookieConsent({
    contentUrl: "/node_modules/cookie-consent-js/cookie-consent-content", // location of the language files
    privacyPolicyUrl: "/privacy-policy.html"
})
```

In `props` you should at least define `contentUrl` and `privacyPolicyUrl`. See below "Configuration properties".

### 5. Enable "Cookie settings" in your service navigation

```html
<a href="javascript:cookieConsent.reset()">Cookie settings</a>
```

So the user can anytime reconfigure, if he wants tracking or not.

### 6. Enable or disable tracking depending on configuration

Client side JavaScript: Surround your tracking code with

```js
if (cookieConsent.trackingAllowed()) {
    // Google Analytics code and/or other tracking code
}
``` 

Server side PHP: Surround your tracking code with

```php
if($_COOKIE['cookie-consent-tracking-allowed'] === 'true') {
    // do some tracking
}
```

All other languages: Just read, if the cookie `cookie-consent-tracking-allowed` is "true"

...that's all! [Contact me](https://shaack.com), if you have questions.

## API

This framework writes a cookie (it's default name is `cookie-consent-tracking-allowed`)
with the value `"true"`, if the user has accepted tracking. You can read the value with the JavaScript
API (`cookieConsent.trackingAllowed()`) or from any other language, server or client side, which can read cookies.

### JavaScript API

#### Show the settings dialog again

```js
cookieConsent.reset()
```

Use this to allow the user to reconfigure the cookie settings, for example, in your service navigation as "Cookie
settings".

#### Read the status

```js
cookieConsent.trackingAllowed()
```

Returns `true` if the user did accept tracking cookies. Use this function to disable tracking. Surround tracking code,
like the Google Analytics code with

```js
if (cookieConsent.trackingAllowed()) {
    // Google Analytics code and/or other tracking code
}
``` 

### Read the status from PHP

Read the cookie from a PHP server with

```php
if($_COOKIE['cookie-consent-tracking-allowed'] === 'true') {
    // do some tracking
}
```

## Configuration properties

With default values.

```js
self.props = {
    buttonPrimaryClass: "btn btn-primary", // the "accept all" buttons class, only used for styling
    buttonSecondaryClass: "btn btn-secondary", // the "accept necessary" buttons class, only used for styling
    autoShowModal: true, // disable autoShowModal on the privacy policy page, to make that page readable
    blockAccess: false, // set "true" to block the access to the website before choosing a cookie configuration
    position: "right", // position ("left" or "right"), if blockAccess is false
    postSelectionCallback: undefined, // callback, after the user has made a selection
    lang: navigator.language, // the language, in which the dialog is shown
    defaultLang: "en", // default language, if the `lang` is not available as translation in `cookie-consent-content`
    content: [], // deprecated, we now have a `content` folder, which contains the language files
    contentUrl: "./cookie-consent-content", // the url of the "cookie-consent-content" folder, which contains the language files
    privacyPolicyUrl: "privacy-policy.html",
    cookieName: "cookie-consent-tracking-allowed",  // the name of the cookie, the cookie is `true` if tracking was accepted
    modalId: "cookieConsentModal" // the id of the modal dialog element
}
```

### Disable autoShow

You can disable `autoShowModal`, for instance, in the privacy policy and legal notice pages to make _these_ pages better
readable.

```js
var cookieConsent = new CookieConsent({
    autoShowModal: false,
    privacyPolicyUrl: "privacy-policy.html",
    contentUrl: "./cookie-consent-content"
})
```

See `./src/cookie-consent.scss` and overwrite values as you need in your project's stylesheet.
